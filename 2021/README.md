### 2021

My personal challenge this year is to write my solutions as functionally as possible.

1. Easy enough
2. Huh, these are long this year
3. Wordy, very wordy
4. Proper types as early as day 4, what is this?!
5. Had to convince myself I wasn't going mad with the maths
6. Brainwave required
7. Almost too easy, is this bait?
8. A fun logic puzzle
9. In order to understand recursion ..
10. Reads as more confusing than it is
11. Kinda fun
12. < Skipped this one >
13. Not too bad, though feels like complexity is a little up and down this year
14. This took longer than it ought to
15. Who even needs Dijsktra?
16. This took far too long, but was very fun
17. Had a wave brain, turned out to be a good one
18. Who needs trees? Not me!
19. Unseasonably difficult .. code is very slow
20. BodgeBodgeBodge!
21. Needed a hint .. first time for everything
22. Strangeness ensues
23. Solved manually, fun game
24. Solved manually, pattern matching
25. Donedid

First time completing the entire calendar (:
