### 2025

First year with only 12 puzzles, by the day 6 half-way point of these I ought to expect day 12~13 level difficulty, where I've historically begun to struggle, and resorted to pulling out real algorithms - this has not been the case!

1. A fun starter
2. Regex goes brr
3. To understand recursion ..
4. The return of grid padding!
5. It's list flattening time
6. Cephalopod maths is strange
7. Reads harder than it really is, honestly no more of a challenge than day 1?
8. Not too difficult once you use a proper type for the graph
9. I thought Part one had lulled me into a false sense of security, but then part two actually was easy
10. Linear algebra goes brr
11. Little bit of caching never hurt anyone
12. Last one being cheap on 'not the 25th' feels wrong somehow .. AoC withdrawal begins now

Overall I don't feel this year was particularly challenging, with maybe only days 8 and 10 presenting a challenge in terms of either a datatype I haven't used in a while, or a library I was unfamiliar with.

The sense of AoC withdrawal over the next few days will feel a bit sour, however.
