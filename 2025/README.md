### 2025

First year with only 12 puzzles, by the day 6 half-way point of these I ought to expect day 12~13 level difficulty, where I've historically begun to struggle, and resorted to pulling out real algorithms.

1. A fun starter
2. Regex goes brr
3. To understand recursion ..
4. The return of grid padding!
5. It's list flattening time
6. Cephalopod maths is strange
7. Reads harder than it really is, honestly no more of a challenge than day 1?
8.
9.
10.
11.
12.
