### Advent of Code

Contains my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) event.

Inside each year you will find solutions in various languages.  This is because I like to do use some of these problems as a warm-up before each year, and as a way to pick up / test out a new language with familiar constructs.  At some point I suspect I'll find a way to clean up the directory structure.

Below is an overview of languages used, with links, to each of these directories:

 * [2015](/2015)
   * Python - Used as warm up for 2021, before I decided to try Ruby
   * Ruby - Used as warm up for 2021
 * [2016](/2016)
   * None yet (will be future warm up / practice)
 * [2017](/2017)
   * Rust - Used as warm up for 2022, before deciding Rust wasn't something I wanted in my life
 * [2018](/2018)
   * None yet (will be future warm up / practice)
 * [2019](/2019)
   * Python
   * Raku - Trying out Raku
 * [2020](/2020)
   * Python
 * [2021](/2021)
   * Ruby - First time finishing the entire calendar
 * [2022](/2022)
   * Python
   * COBOL - Yes really
