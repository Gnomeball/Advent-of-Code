### 2022

No challenge this year, just get them all done.

1. I don't like any of my solutions to this one
2. Pre-computation lets go
3. Super dumb one liner (PS; don't write code like that please)
4. Caught me out more times than I would like to admit
5. This one feels more complicated than it is, mostly due to messy parsing
6. Feels too easy
7. Absolute Galaxy Brain Solution!
8. This caught me out so many times... Reading is hard!
9. Is this just snake?
10. Feels more complicated than it probably is
11. Wall of text, actually quite fun
12. Elves clearly don't suffer fall damage
13. To understand recursion ...
14. Slow, and I dun lyke it
15. Took me way too many hours to notice that speed up
16. This one had me stumped, until the brain kicked into gear
17. I stayed up to 4 am to finish this, I wouldn't sleep until it was done!
18. I don't like this because I basically cheated with the import
19. Definitely harder than last year
20. Well, that's certainly a step down in difficulty
21. Complex numbers can be useful!
22. Oh ... ok then 
23.
24.
25.
